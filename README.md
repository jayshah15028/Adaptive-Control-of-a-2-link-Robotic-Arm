# Adaptive-Control-of-a-2-link-Robotic-Arm

Robotic Manipulators are used extensively in the manufacturing and logistics industries. The need for accuracy and precision and has been fulfilled by these robots. For these kinds of applications, usually, robots are hard-coded with the system parameters passed as constants or discrete variables with specified conditions on their values. The current need in the industry is to make manufacturing facilities smarter. For this, the robots have to be smart and the hard-coding technique does not work. In this project, a 2-link robotic arm is analyzed and a controller has been designed to perform steadily and trace a smooth trajectory under parameter uncertainty. 

A brief overview of the process and result of this project can be seen at https://jayshah15028.urspace.io/project/Adaptive-Control-of-a-2link-Robotic-Manipulator-16587. Please refer to the codes and report for a complete understanding of the project.

## Running Requirements and Dependencies for the Codes:

* All the files need to be in the same folder
* The Simulator files are independent of each other
* The files with the name of controllers are the functions called in the corresponding simulation file
